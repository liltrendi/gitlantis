## Features

- **🚤 Real-Time 3D Exploration**  
  Control a boat that sails across your project’s sea. Move through code like you're exploring uncharted territory.

- **🗼 Folders as Interactive Towers**  
  Each folder appears as a lighthouse you can interact with to dive deeper into your project's structure.

- **🛟 Files as Floating Buoys**  
  Encounter files as yellow buoys bobbing in the ocean — click to open them directly in your editor.

- **🧭 Immersive Minimap Compass**  
  A dynamic compass and minimap help you navigate your codebase like a seasoned sea captain. Easily locate nearby files, folders, and landmarks.

- **🧵 Breadcrumb Trails**  
  Never get lost. Breadcrumbs show your current location in the oceanic file system, letting you jump back to parent directories with a click.
