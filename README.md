# 🚢 Gitlantis

[**Gitlantis**](https://gitlantis.brayo.co) transforms the way you explore your project files by turning your codebase into an immersive ocean world. Navigate your folders and files by interacting with the floating lighthouses and buoys — it’s a unique, fun, and creative way to visually explore and manage your code.

## 🌊 Features

- **🚤 Real-Time 3D Exploration**  
  Control a boat that sails across your project’s sea. Move through code like you're exploring uncharted territory.

- **🗼 Folders as Tall Lighthouses**  
  Each folder appears as a lighthouse you can interact with to dive deeper into your project's structure.

- **🛟 Files as Short Buoys**  
  Encounter files as smaller buoys bobbing in the ocean — click to open them directly in your editor.

- **🗺️ Immersive Minimap**  
  A general minimap that shows you an overhead overview relative to your boat. Easily locate nearby files and folders.

- **🧭 Comprehensive Compass**  
  A dynamic compass to help you navigate your codebase like a seasoned sea captain. Never lose your sense of direction!

- **🧵 Breadcrumb Trails**  
  Never get lost. Breadcrumbs show your current location in the oceanic file system, letting you jump back to parent directories with a click or by pressing `Escape`.

- **⚙️ Configurable Settings**  
  Tailor your journey! Toggle features like breadcrumbs, minimap size, splash screen behavior, and more — all from within the extension settings.
